Code associated with habitat-Giardia-gut bacteria project
Description: These files will allow you to replicate the analyses we used to assess the impact of habitat disturbance and Giardia infection on the A. caraya gut microbiome. There is a file for 16S rRNA gene amplicon data (QIIME2_code) and a file for R analyses (R_code). Metadata files can be found at doi:10.5061/dryad.wm37pvmj5 on Dryad.
